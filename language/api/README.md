# Google Cloud Natural Language API Samples

These samples show how to use the [Google Cloud Natural Language API][language-api]
to analyze text.

This repository contains samples that use the [Google Cloud
Library for PHP][google-cloud-php] to make REST calls as well as
contains samples using the more-efficient (though sometimes more
complex) [GRPC][grpc] API. The GRPC API also allows streaming requests.
